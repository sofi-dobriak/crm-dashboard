# ðŸ“Š CRM Dashboard

This is an educational project built to practice working with Sass (SCSS) and modern layout techniques.

---

The project helped me learn how to:

-  Structure styles in larger projects
-  Use variables, mixins, and nesting in SCSS
-  Organize code for readability and maintainability
-  build responsive interfaces

âš¡ The main idea is to create a CRM-style dashboard with a clean design and a well-structured component layout.

ðŸ”§ Technologies used:

- HTML5
- CSS3 / SCSS

ðŸš€ This project is educational and demonstrates my basic understanding of how Sass can be applied in real development.
